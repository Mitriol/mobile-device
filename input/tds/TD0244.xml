                        shall be included in the ST. This requirement does not limit the elliptic curves the client may
                        propose for authentication and key agreement. Rather, it asks the ST author to define which of
                        the NIST curves from FCS_COP.1(3) and FCS_CKM.1 and FCS_CKM.2(1) the TOE supports. This
                        extension is required for clients supporting Elliptic Curve ciphersuites.

                    <aactivity>The evaluator shall verify that TSS describes the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and
                        whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured. If the TSS indicates
                        that the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension must be configured to meet the requirement, the
                        evaluator shall verify that AGD guidance includes configuration of the Supported Elliptic Curves
                        Extension.
