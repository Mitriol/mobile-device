                        <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.1.1"></linkref> lists the rules for validating certificates. The <abbr
                            linkend="ST"></abbr> author shall select whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or
                        CRLs.
                        OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling only support TLS server certificate validation. If other
                        certificate types are validated, either OCSP or CRL should be claimed.
                        The WLAN Client EP to which a MDF <abbr linkend="TOE"></abbr> must also conform requires that
                        certificates are used for EAP-TLS; this use requires that the
                        extendedKeyUsage rules are verified. Certificates may optionally be used for trusted
                        updates of system software and applications (<linkref linkend="FPT_TUD_EXT.2"></linkref>) and
                        for integrity verification (<linkref linkend="FPT_TST_EXT.2(1)"></linkref>) and, if implemented,
                        must be validated to contain the Code Signing purpose
                        extendedKeyUsage. <h:br></h:br>
                        <h:br></h:br> While <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.1.1"></linkref> requires that the <abbr
                            linkend="TOE"></abbr> perform certain checks on the certificate presented by a TLS server,
                        there are corresponding
                        checks that the authentication server will have to perform on the certificate presented by the
                        client; namely that the extendedKeyUsage field of the client certificate includes "Client
                        Authentication" and that the key agreement bit (for the Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites) or the
                        key encipherment bit (for RSA ciphersuites) be set. Certificates obtained for use by the <abbr
                            linkend="TOE"></abbr> will have to conform to these requirements in order to be used in the
                        enterprise. This check is
                        required to support EAP-TLS for the WLAN Client EP.

                                purpose and verify that validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is selected, the

                                        designated as a trust anchor, and an EC certificate designated as a trusted
                                        anchor, where the elliptic curve parameters are specified as a named curve. The
                                        evaluator shall confirm that the TOE validates the certificate chain.

                                    <h:li>Test 8b: (Conditional on support for EC certificates as indicated in
                                        FCS_COP.1(3)). The evaluator shall replace the intermediate certificate in the
                                        certificate chain for Test 8a with a modified certificate, where the modified
                                        intermediate CA has a public key information field where the EC parameters uses
                                        an explicit format version of the Elliptic Curve parameters in the public key
                                        information field of the intermediate CA certificate from Test 8a, and the
                                        modified Intermediate CA certificate is signed by the trusted EC root CA, but
                                        having no other changes. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE treats the
                                        certificate as invalid.
